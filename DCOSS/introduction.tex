\section{Introduction}
To mention: The main goal of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is to monitor the environment, thus WSNs are inherently environment dependent. It leads to a number of situations and combinations of situations, which programmer should be care of, and because of that applications for WSNs are usually very complex. It is hard to read, reuse, debug and maintain this kind of applications.

We are claiming that the notion of Context in a low-level software will significantly improve these aspects (readability and reusability of the code as well as debugging and maintaining of the application).

Since WSNs are usually built on embedded platforms, there are CPU, memory, energy consumption and even language restrictions.

To mention: structure of the paper.
