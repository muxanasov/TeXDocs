\section{Introduction}
To mention: The main goal of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is to monitor the environment, thus WSNs are inherently environment dependent. It leads to a number of situations and combinations of situations, which programmer should be care of, and because of that applications for WSNs are usually very complex. It is hard to read, reuse, debug and maintain this kind of applications.

We are claiming that the notion of Context in a low-level software will significantly improve these aspects (readability and reusability of the code as well as debugging and maintaining of the application).

Since WSNs are usually built on embedded platforms, there are CPU, memory, energy consumption and even language restrictions.

Consider for example a wildlife tracking application\cite{pasztor10}, whose goals are to track a location and movement of animals, and to analyze communication between them.  GPS-sensor and accelerometer are used to detect different activities of an animal. Thus it is possible to save energy by varying the rate of location readings. There is no need to track a location if an animal is \emph{not moving}, but should accelerometer detect any significant movement, a periodic sampling will be initiated. Increased difference between two location readings indicates that an animal is \emph{running}, and sampling operations should be more often.

Communication activity can be detected by sending and receiving beacons via low-power radio module. Thus, two animals are considered communicating if their nodes receive beacons of each other. But it is possible to reduce a traffic and save energy by detecting a social activity. \emph{Leader} is communicating with the most animals in a herd and receiving beacons from them. Thus there is no need to send beacons from a leader.

Orthogonal to application-level functionality, system should transmit data to the Base Station (BS) or save readings locally depending on the BS availability. While there is \emph{no BS} within the range, GPS-sensor is used to get the location and data is written in internal memory. But should the node receive a beacon, the data is dumped and GPS-sensor is disabled since location can be acquired from the BS. The application also should be aware of battery status and disable power consuming modules like GPS and GPRS if the battery level is \emph{low}.
