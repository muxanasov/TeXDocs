\section{Introduction} To mention: The main goal of Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSNs) is to monitor the environment, thus WSNs are inherently environment
dependent. It leads to a number of situations and combinations of situations,
which programmer should be care of, and because of that applications for WSNs
are usually very complex. It is hard to read, reuse, debug and maintain this
kind of applications.

We are claiming that the notion of Context in a low-level software will
significantly improve these aspects (readability and re-usability of the code as
well as debugging and maintaining of the application).

Since WSNs are usually built on embedded platforms, there are CPU, memory,
energy consumption and even language restrictions.

Consider for example a wildlife tracking application\cite{pasztor10}, whose
goals are to track a location and movement of animals, and to analyze
communications between them. Here GPS-sensor and accelerometer are used to
detect different activities of an animal. Communication activity can be detected
by sending and receiving beacons via low-power radio module. Two animals are
considered communicating if their nodes receive beacons of each other.

In order to save energy we have to foresee different situation a system could
find itself in. In our application for example there is no need to track a
location if an animal is \emph{not moving}, but should accelerometer detect any
significant movement, a periodic sampling should be initiated. Increased
difference between two location readings indicates that an animal is
\emph{running}, and sampling operations should be more often. Thus, it is
possible to save energy by varying the rate of location readings. We also can
exploit a social activity of animals to reduce a traffic and save energy.
\emph{Leader} is communicating with the most animals in a herd and receiving
beacons from them. Thus, there is no need to send beacons from a leader.

Orthogonal to application-level functionality, system should transmit data to
the Base Station (BS) or save readings locally depending on the BS availability.
While there is \emph{no BS} within the range, GPS-sensor is used to get the
location and data is written in internal memory. But should the node receive a
beacon from the BS, the data is dumped and GPS-sensor is disabled since location
can be acquired from the BS. The application also should be aware of battery
status and disable power consuming modules like GPS and GPRS if the battery
level is \emph{low}.
