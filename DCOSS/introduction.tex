\section{Introduction} To mention: The main goal of Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSNs) is to monitor the environment, thus WSNs are inherently environment
dependent. It leads to a number of situations and combinations of situations,
which programmer should be care of, and because of that applications for WSNs
are usually very complex. It is hard to read, reuse, debug and maintain this
kind of applications.

We are claiming that the notion of Context in a low-level software will
significantly improve these aspects (readability and re-usability of the code
aswell as debugging and maintaining of the application).

Since WSNs are usually built on embedded platforms, there are CPU, memory,
energy consumption and even language restrictions.

Consider for example a wildlife tracking application\cite{pasztor10}, whose
goals are to track a location and movement of animals, and to analyze social
interactions between them. Here GPS-sensor and accelerometer are used to detect
different activities of an animal. Communication activity can be detectedby
sending and receiving beacons via low-power radio module. Two animals are
considered interacting if their nodes receive beacons of each other.

To mention: structure of the paper.
