\section{Future work}

An open problem of our research are possible conflicts and nontrivial
logical errors of context-oriented model of the application. To leverage it, we
put a domain-specific model checking in our research agenda.

To our knowledge there is also a lack of programming environment for
self-adaptive applications for CPSs. Our early analysis shows that complexity
can be decreased by 9\%, if the skeleton of the application based on the diagram
akin to the one in Figure~\ref{fig:design} is generated by IDE.

Another direction of our research is to investigate context-oriented programming
for other CPS platforms, such as aerial drones.
