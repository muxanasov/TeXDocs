\section{Future work}\label{sec:future}

An open problem of our research are possible conflicts and nontrivial logical
errors in the context-oriented model of the application. They can be hardly
foreseen at the design-time, but at run-time they could bring the system to an
unpredicted behavior. To address this issue, we put a domain-specific model
checking in our research agenda.

To our knowledge, there is also a lack of programming environment for
self-adaptive applications for CPSs. Our early analysis shows that complexity
can be decreased by 9\%, if the skeleton of the application based on the diagram
akin to the one in Figure~\ref{fig:design} is automatically generated by an IDE.

As a part of our further research, we are about to investigate context-oriented
programming for other CPS platforms. For example, aerial drones may form a smart
mobile network for such task as assisting in archeological excavations or
delivery service. We believe, our approach -- possibly with minor changes --
will fit for this type of systems as well.
