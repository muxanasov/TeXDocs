\section{Future work}

This work is a first step to provide a design-time support for creating
self-adaptive applications for resource restricted CPSs. Our approach results in
effectively structured self-adaptive applications, while costs are negligible.

Since there were neither design-time support nor developing environment for
self-adaptive applications for CPSs, the next step of our research
could be implementation of the latter. On the current stage we
generate nesC code based on programmer notations in \conesc. It increases the
number of LOC, since developer needs to declare components, wiring and
transitions akin those displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:design}. We are intended to
develop a skeleton code generator, which could decrease the amount of source code
developer needs to write, as it was shown in Section~\ref{sec:eval}.

Another open problems of our research are possible conflicts and nontrivial
logical errors of context-oriented model of the application. To leverage it, we
put a domain-specific model checking in our research agenda.
