\section{Future work}

To our knowledge there is a lack of programming environment for self-adaptive
applications for CPSs. Our early analysis shows that complexity can be
decreased by 9\% by having an IDE, which generates the skeleton of the
application based on the diagram akin to the one in Figure~\ref{fig:design}.

Another open problem of our research are possible conflicts and nontrivial
logical errors of context-oriented model of the application. To leverage it, we
put a domain-specific model checking in our research agenda.
