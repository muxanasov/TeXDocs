\section{Future work}

An open problem of our research are possible conflicts and nontrivial
logical errors of context-oriented model of the application. To leverage it, we
put a domain-specific model checking in our research agenda.

To our knowledge there is also a lack of programming environment for
self-adaptive applications for CPSs. Our early analysis shows that complexity
can be decreased by 9\%, if the skeleton of the application based on the diagram
akin to the one in Figure~\ref{fig:design} is generated by IDE.

CPSs platforms have a great variety of applications, as for example in aerial
drones. The latter may form a smart mobile WSN for such task as an assistance in
archeological excavation or delivery service. As a part of our further research,
we are about to investigate context-oriented programming for this CPS platform.
