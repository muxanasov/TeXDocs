\section{Future work}

This work is a first step to provide a design-time support for creating
self-adaptive applications. Our evaluations show that our approach results in
effectively structured self-adaptive applications, while costs are negligible.

Since there were neither design-time support nor developing environment for
developing self-adaptive applications for CPSs, the next step of our research
could be implementation of the latter. On the current stage of our research we
generate nesC code based on programmer notations in \conesc, what increases of
LOC, since developer needs to declare bindings and transitions akin those
displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:design}. To reduce the latter, we are intended to
develop a boilerplate code generator, which could decrease amount of LOC
developer needs to write, as it was shown in Section~\ref{sec:eval}.

Another open problems of our research are possible conflicts and nontrivial
logical errors of context-oriented model of the application. To leverage this
problem, we put a domain-specific model checking in our research agenda.
