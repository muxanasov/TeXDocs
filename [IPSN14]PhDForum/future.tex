\section{Future work}

An open problem of our research are possible conflicts and nontrivial logical
errors of context-oriented model of the application. They can be hardly foreseen
at the design-time, but at run-time they could bring the system to unpredicted
behavior. To leverage it, we put a domain-specific model checking in our
research agenda.

To our knowledge there is also a lack of programming environment for
self-adaptive applications for CPSs. Our early analysis shows that complexity
can be decreased by 9\%, if the skeleton of the application based on the diagram
akin to the one in Figure~\ref{fig:design} is generated by IDE.

As a part of our further research, we are about to investigate context-oriented
programming for other CPS platforms. For example, aerial drones --
representatives of a typical CPS platform -- may form a smart mobile network for
such task as an assistance in archeological excavations or delivery service. We
believe, our approach -- possibly with minor changes -- will fit for this type of
network.
