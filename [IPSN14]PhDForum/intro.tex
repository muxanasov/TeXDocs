\section{Introduction}
Cyberphysical systems (CPSs) are usually used to gather data form and take actions
on the real world. Because of environment dynamics, CPS software is required to
self-adapt to different situations. It is hard to achieve having limited resources.

There are many contributions related to self-adaptive embedded
systems~\cite{Zimmerling12,Bourdenas11}, they are, however, very problem
specific. A more general approach includes COP paradigm~\cite{Hirschfeld08},
which is implemented in several high-level
languages~\cite{Bardram05,Ghezzi10,Kamina11,Salvaneschi12,Sehic11}. Most of them
are not applicable for the embedded systems, because of resource limitations. In
this area CPSs are usually seen as sources of raw data~\cite{Sehic11}.

Our approach targets the applications where complexity arises form the
combination of the environmental dimensions. By borrowing COP concepts and
bringing them down to he low-level software, we aim to provide a programming 
support to enable self-adaptive behavior at design-time.
