\begin{abstract}
We present our work towards self-adaptive software for extremely
resource-constrained cyberphysical systems \\(CPSs). The software for the latter
generally needs to adapt to unpredictable environmental dynamics under limited
resources. Our approach provides design concepts and language support for
developing such software. To this end, we bring a notion of context-oriented
design and programming down to embedded platforms, while the system overhead is
negligible.
