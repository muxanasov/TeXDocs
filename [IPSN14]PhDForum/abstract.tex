\begin{abstract}
We present our work towards self-adaptive software for extremely resource
constrained cyberphysical systems (CPSs). It is difficult in general to develop
a software, which adapts to unpredictable environmental dynamics, and even more
having limited resources. Our approach meets these challenges and provides
design concepts and language support for developing such software. We bring a
notion of context-oriented design and programming down to embedded platforms.
Our results show that, while enabling context-oriented design, we pay a price of
negligible system overhead.
