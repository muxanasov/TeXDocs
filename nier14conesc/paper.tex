\section{Introduction}

\noindent Nuggets to play as motivation:
\begin{itemize}
\item CPSs intimately tied to the environment;
\item WSNs are an extreme case of resource constraint;
\item applications need to evolve because i)  requirements change,
  ii) environment changes, iii) nodes possibly move;
\item software development rather primitive, no established methodologies, low-level languages;
\item resource constraints make things worse: no dynamic memory
  allocation, fixed component bindings, ...
\end{itemize}

Follows a description of the approach: use a notion of context (and
context groups) at the design stage together with dedicated COP
support during the implementation. We are the first to bring a similar
approach down to extremely resource-constrained platforms.

Throughout the paper, use wildlife monitoring application as running
example.

\section{Design Concepts}

Definition of context, context group, transitions among contexts, and
related constraints (towards an error context, or preventing a
transition).

\section{Programming Support}

This is going to be a primer on ConesC, with a mapping from the
concepts in the previous section to specific language constructs.

\section{Preliminary Evaluation}
\noident Three key aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item qualitatively compare ConesC and nesC implementations along
  coupling, dependencies, programmer-visible program states, ...
\item demonstrates that changing the application (for example, adding
  a new context) is easier in ConesC than nesC;
\item shows a few figures on run-time overhead to demonstrate the
  approach is feasible.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

This is the end, pointers to ongoing and future work.
