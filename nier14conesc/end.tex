\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:ending}

We presented the first attempt at providing design-time and
programming support for self-adaptive software in
re\-sour\-ce-constrained CPSs. In this domain, the lack of a
principled design approach and the rudimentary programming
environments result in entangled implementations. To remedy this, we
conceived dedicated design concepts and COP extensions to low-level
CPS programming languages. Preliminary results indicate that our
approach yields implementations that are easier to test,
maintain, and evolve. The run-time overhead to pay is, nonetheless,
negligible.

Our immediate research agenda includes automatic generation of \conesc
code from graphical notations akin to Figure~\ref{fig:design}, and
domain-specific model checking of context-oriented CPS applications
built based on our approach.
