\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:ending}

We presented design-time and programming support for self-adaptive
software in resource-constrained CPSs. In this domain, the lack of a
principled design approach and the existing rudimentary programming
environments result in entangled implementations. To address this
issue, we conceived dedicated design concepts and COP extensions to
low-level CPS programming languages. Preliminary results indicate that
our approach yields better structured implementations that are easier
to test, maintain, and evolve. The run-time overhead to pay is to gain
these advantages is, nonetheless, negligible.
