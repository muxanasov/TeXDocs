\begin{abstract}
  We present a context-oriented approach to design and implement
  self-adaptive component-based software in resource-con\-strain\-ed
  cyberphysical systems (CPSs). Because of unpredictable environment
  dynamics, developers must design and implement CPS software to
  dynamically adapt to widely different situations. Our approach
  provides design concepts and language support to achieve this
  against severe resource constraints. To this end, we bring a notion
  of context-oriented design and programming down to platforms
  that---because of extreme resource constraints---currently leverage
  fairly undisciplined design techniques and rather rudimentary
  component-based frameworks. Early results de\-monstrate that our
  approach improves the quality of the resulting implementations
  facilitating testing, maintenance, and evolution at the price of a
  negligible system overhead.
