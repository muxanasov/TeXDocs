\begin{abstract}
  We present a context-oriented approach to develop self-adaptive
  software for extremely resource-constrained cyber-physical systems
  (CPSs). % These are sensing and actuating systems deployed in the
  % physical world whose operation is controlled by a computing and
  % communication core.
  Because of unpredictable environment dynamics, developers must
  design and implement CPS software to dynamically adapt to widely
  different situations. Our approach provides design concepts and
  language support to achieve this against extreme resource
  constraints. To this end, we bring a notion of context-oriented
  design and programming down to platforms that---because of extreme
  resoruce constraints---currently leverage failry unstructured design
  techniques and rather basic programming environments. Early results
  demonstrate that our approach greatly simplifies the design and
  implementation of adaptive CPS software in this domain, at the price
  of a modest system overhead that however does not impact the overall
  software feasibility. To our knowledge, we are the first to enable
  context-oriented design and programming in similarly-constrained
  platforms.
