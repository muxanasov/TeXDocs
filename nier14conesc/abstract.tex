\begin{abstract}
  We present a context-oriented approach to develop self-adaptive
  software for extremely resource-constrained cyber-physical systems
  (CPSs). % These are sensing and actuating systems deployed in the
  % physical world whose operation is controlled by a computing and
  % communication core.
  Because of unpredictable environment dynamics, CPS software must be
  designed and implemented to dynamically adapt to widely different
  situations. Our approach provides design concepts and language
  support to achieve this against extreme resource constraints. To
  this end, we bring a notion of context-oriented design and
  programming down to platforms with only a few KBytes of memory and
  currently leveraging rather basic programming environments. Early
  results demonstrate that our approach greatly simplifies the design
  and implementation of adaptive CPS software at the price of a modest
  system overhead. To our knowledge, we are the first to enable
  context-oriented design and programming in similarly-constrained
  platforms.
