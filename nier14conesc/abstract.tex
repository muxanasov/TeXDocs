\begin{abstract}
  We present a context-oriented approach to design and implement
  self-adaptive software for extremely resource-con\-strain\-ed
  cyberphysical systems
  (CPSs). % These are sensing and actuating systems deployed in the
  % physical world whose operation is controlled by a computing and
  % communication core.
  Because of unpredictable environment dynamics, developers must
  design and implement CPS software to dynamically adapt to widely
  different situations. Our approach provides design concepts and
  language support to achieve this against extreme resource
  constraints. To this end, we bring a notion of context-oriented
  design and programming down to platforms that---because of extreme
  resource constraints---currently leverage fairly undisciplined
  design techniques and rather basic programming environments. Early
  results demonstrate that our approach greatly simplifies the design
  and implementation of adaptive CPS software in this domain, at the
  price of a negligible system overhead. To our knowledge, we are the
  first to enable context-oriented design and programming in
  similarly-constrained platforms.
